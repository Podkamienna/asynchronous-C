# asynchronous-C
Implementation of a solution to a problem from concurrent programming taught at MIMUW in the year 2019/20. Includes the implementation of a threadpool and future-promise pair in C language. Examples of usage are shown in macierz.c and silnia.c. The first one shows using the threadpool to concurrently calculate the sums of rows from a given matrix. The second one calculates a factorial of a given number concurrently with use of future-promise pair and threadpool.
